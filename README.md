# Future Improvements

# Wins
* My own code and previous designs!
* Learning from my old mistakes
* Solid Planning
* Working in sprints - My trello board listed all of my user stories, but I wanted to work in sprints based on the time I had alloted to complete the challenge.
I listed out all of the items I wanted to accomplish so they would be in front of me, motivating me throughout the day.  In a sense, I played all of the roles on my one woman team. 
* Lecture Materials
